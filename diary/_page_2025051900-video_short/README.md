## Transcript

My watch collection has come miles from where it started, and now that I’m almost settling with these, I realize there is no G-Shock Square, and a part of it is intentional. Back when I got the GW-6900, I was on the fence between that and the GWM-5610u, but kept the latter for the future. However, after experiencing the Master of G Collection, I don’t think I’m ever going back. The Mudman, MudMaster, and the GravityMaster cover a lot by themselves with twin sensors, quad sensors, moon phase, etc., and when I need something that just stays out of the way, there’s always the GA-2110. Can you guess which one my hand reaches for by default? Let me know in the comments.

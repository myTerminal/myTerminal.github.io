## One Size Doesn’t Fit All

Just like everything else in this world, computers aren’t one size fits all either. What might work for me might not work for you and vice versa. It is more important that you get your hands on what you need and not what a reviewer on the internet thinks is the best computer to buy.

## A Few Criteria

A machine can differ from another in many aspects, a few of them being as follows:

1. **Segment/Category:** A gaming laptop may be able to serve as a machine for video editing and vice-versa, at least to a certain extent, but it may not be the best choice for travel.
2. **Size:** More so for laptops, size makes a huge difference, as it also determines how large the screen is. This is something that will also depend on what you prefer. Usually work machines are better with larger screens and machines for travel or note-taking could be fine with a smaller one.
3. **Weight:** Who’d like to have a machine that weighs more than it needs to? Power usually comes with weight, and if you’re looking for something that needs to be often carried, weight could be an important variable.
4. **Screen technology:** There are a lot of variations in screens these days, not only in display technology but also in other factors like contrast ratios, refresh rates, etc.

Needless to say, these are just a few examples, and the criteria you may need to consider will be more than just these.

## Genre-Based Criteria

There are also genre-based criteria. For example, you cannot have a machine with a lightweight graphics processor to edit videos or carry a thick and heavy machine that eats battery with you around the world.

## Other Criteria

Apart from these, you may have your own requirements that might also be imposed in the process. Some of us for example like to have a longer warranty duration and the best customer support they can get. The others though, just need something for as little money as possible.

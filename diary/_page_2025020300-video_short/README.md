## Transcript

It hasn’t been long since I replaced the CPU thermal paste on this ThinkPad X201. However, there’s one in a hundred probability of it refusing to start with a “Fan Error”. I certainly do not want that to happen when this one is with its new owner hopefully soon, and I had a spare CPU fan anyway, so… I do not exactly enjoy this procedure, especially since I did this on the last few machines where I didn’t have to take every single component apart. Also, isn't it funny how before you learn how to do something, you don’t even need it done? But the moment you figure it out, you’re doing it every other week! Anyway, thankfully I could cheat by simply replacing the fan without touching the CPU and heatsink, now this one's as good as new!

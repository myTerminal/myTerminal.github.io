## Transcript

So obviously, the Berny AM139M wasn’t my last automatic wrist watch. I was still keeping my eyes on some more premium-looking watches, and that is when I came across this San Martin SN0113W.

To say that this watch is gorgeous would be an understatement. Just as the Berny, this watch turned out to be a homage to a much more expensive Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra.

For obvious reasons, my only point of reference for comparison is the Berny AM139M, so that’s what I’ll compare it with. This one doesn’t have the rotating inner bezel, it loses the day of the week window on the dial, and even the exhibition case back. It has a lower water resistance rating at only a hundred meters, is heavier in terms of weight, and is quite a lot more expensive in terms of cost.

But that’s pretty much where the negatives end. It comes with a compact case that fits better on my smaller wrist, has AR-coating on the sapphire crystal, has a full metallic strap with an adjustable clasp, and a more reliable NH35 movement. This one goes quite well on formals, even after being one of my smallest watches alongside the Casio Forester.

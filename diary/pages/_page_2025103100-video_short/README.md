You may have seen this ThinkPad T430 make a guest appearance in one of my earlier videos, and it had quite a few issues. So here is how I prepared it for its new home:

1. I fixed the battery error on startup by replacing the CMOS battery.
2. I performed a deep clean and reapplied fresh thermal paste.
3. I added a 128GB storage drive with Endeavor OS.
4. The battery that came with the machine was dead. So I added a pre-owned genuine battery, instead of a brand-new aftermarket one.
5. Finally, I added a 90W power adapter to make it all ready to go.

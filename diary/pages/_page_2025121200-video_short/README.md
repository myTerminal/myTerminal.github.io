## Transcript

One brand I’ve been eyeing for a while is Seiko, including their monster offerings. These are expensive, and I haven’t been able to convince myself to spend so much on a watch, even on used examples. But then several homages like this Steeldive are pretty close to the Seiko Monster, as mentioned all over the web, especially for a fraction of the price.

I chose blue because black is too monochromatic, and I found the other colors either too warm or not to my liking on a watch dial. The blue is great, adds plenty of contrast, and should be wearable on more occasions than the other colors. This thing is heavy, and even bolder than the Phoibos. The packaging and box were just the same as the San Martin and the Addiesdive, and I love how they include adjustment tools right in the box.

After receiving it, I realized, maybe I’m not a fan of this style, at least yet. It does look great in sunlight. The metal bracelet is OK, and this clasp is inconvenient. The dial is fair enough, and the lume is bright, but it dims down very quickly. The feel of the crown is the best element on this watch, very close to the San Martin.

I’m not sure how different the Seiko Monster is from this homage, as I may not be able to experience it myself, and I think I’ll need to give it some time to grow on me.

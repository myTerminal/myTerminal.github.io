## Transcript

The G-Shock GW-500A is similar to most other digital G-Shocks and comes with all the standard features like world time, 5 alarms with hourly chime signals, stopwatch, and a few other advanced features like solar charging, multi-band radio reception, auto-EL backlight, etc. The design is a little what I’d call ergonomic, with everything starting from one end of the strap through the bezel to the other end of the strap feeling like a continuous fluid design.

Apart from the two small sub-dials being used for status indicators for various features, as we usually see in G-Shocks, the larger one on the left is used for minutes of the hour, such that it divides the hour into twelve sections, and that is what shows up in there.

If you have noticed, we’re missing one feature that we see in all G-Shocks and even Casio digital watches: the countdown timer. This watch doesn't have it and instead replaces it with a time memo feature that records a time stamp when you keep the upper right button pressed. You can go into that mode to recall those time memos, and those can also be cleared using a long press on the adjust button on the top left.

This GW-530A is the same watch with a slightly different finish and materials.

So, would you trade the countdown timer for a time memo feature? I don’t know.

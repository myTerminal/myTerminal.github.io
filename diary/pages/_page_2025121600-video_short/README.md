## Transcript

After using several non-GShocks, and more so, automatic watches, it was about time I performed the mod I had been waiting for several months now. So this GA-2110, just like all other variants, only has lume on the hands, and that looks incomplete, especially when you compare it with other watches like this Phoibos. Thankfully, this is a pretty simple and cost-effective mod you can do on a CasiOak. Additionally, the dial markers on this colorway are too muted, and it would be great to add more contrast to the dial.

I purchased this aftermarket marker ring, and the color is very close to that of the hands. If you’re careful with the process and avoid elements like dust and scratches, the procedure is pretty simple, especially on the non-Bluetooth and non-solar variants, like this one here.

Simply remove the straps for convenience, undo the four screws, remove the cover plate, rubber insulation, and o-ring, detach the movement/module from the case, pry off the stock marker ring, place the new one, and then reassemble everything carefully in the reverse order. Let us take a second or two to admire the new look on the dial.

So here is how it was before the mod, and here is how it looks now. This is how it looks side-by-side. Also, I like how the hands now complement the hour markers. I guess that was worth it.

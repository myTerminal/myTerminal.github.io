## Transcript

I’ve briefly mentioned the cursor assistant on the UniHertz Titan 2 a couple of times now, and I think there’s still a lot to talk about it.

Officially, it’s only supposed to let you move the cursor as soon as you double-tap on the keyboard.

But then we saw how tapping on the keyboard can trigger taps on the touchscreen at a relative position, but I do not find that intuitive, and would rather disable that feature, while keeping the rest of the cursor scroll functionality.

But then I discovered another interesting, or rather unexpected behavior, when I accidentally rested my thumb on the keyboard and dragged it. It triggered a drag-and-drop kind of gesture. First of all, with this, I have a lot of questions. And, if this is how complex the gesture support for this keyboard is, none of which is documented by the way, at least according to my knowledge, I’m curious to find out if there’s anything beyond that.

Let me know in the comments if there’s anything else you have discovered.

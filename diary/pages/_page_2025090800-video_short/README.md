## Transcript

I had been trying hard to get into Seiko’s, but neither was I attached to the brand as many folks online seem to be, nor could I justify spending on one yet, with offerings from so many other brands with much higher value for money, like my two recently acquired homage watches.

With every other dive watch appearing to be very similar, I found this PHOIBOS (and I’m sure I mispronounced it) Leviathan PY032C convincing enough to get, and it has a lot going for it. It is huge, bold, and angular, and comes with a Seiko movement with 40 hours of power reserve, a sapphire crystal, a ceramic unidirectional rotating bezel, strong lume on the face, including hands, markers, and the bezel, and 500 meters of water-resistance with a Helium Escape Valve, which I had never seen before.

I learned that the Helium Escape Valve is a technology that is used in dive watches for saturation diving, and is something that most of these would never even see a use for.

If you could get over the massive size, the super-thick rubber strap, and a few other design elements, this thing is unique and amazing. I love the double keepers, with one of them held in place using these keeper-keepers. Additionally, I appreciate that the factory straps are quick-release, allowing one to replace them with something thinner. By the way, the end of the strap does remind me of the G-Shock Frogman fin.

If you're familiar with my history with wristwatches, you’ll understand my skepticism of larger watches like the G-Shock Mudmaster GWG-2000. However, after wearing this behemoth, I do not consider my wrist slender anymore. Also, the name brings me memories of that special encounter my Shepard had over 40 thousand feet below the surface back in 2012. Such good old days!

## Transcript

So, I installed Windows XP on my other ThinkPad T60 as well, and man, was I delighted! I used a 256GB SATA III SSD, swapping out the one I had set up with Void Linux. It did take three attempts because, at first, my disc 2 went bad, and then the recovery software couldn’t work with 4GB RAM, so I tried with 2GB, and it all went through.

Now, when I picked up my first T60, I couldn’t have imagined the memories it would bring back. I mean, look at this thing. Who would believe this twenty-year-old notebook, which was not even designed for video games, can do it so well? Yes, it stinks the same way as most of my seven other ThinkPads from this era, and gets more attention at home just for that than the stunning looks.

So, this thing can run GTA III Liberty City at full settings with occasional stutters, and I do not even need a mouse with the TrackPoint in place. Maybe it’s just me, but as much as I love Steam, the number of gaming hours being counted makes me anxious. Here, there is no Steam, just me in Liberty City driving relatively pixelated vehicles with precision as if I were playing Dirt Rally or Assetto Corsa Rally. It’s less about metrics and more about having a good time.

I wanted to build something like this earlier, and I’m glad that I didn’t do it with a relatively modern ThinkPad like the T430, and instead waited for the real retro machine to make its way to me. I literally couldn’t have been happier.

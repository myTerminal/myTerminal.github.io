## Transcript

The G-Shock Mudman G-9300 has a lot going for it. Apart from your standard digital G-Shock modes, there’s also a mode to check the age of the moon, which may appear useless at first, but then you never know when you may need to check on how far the month of Ramadan is. And then you have the regular goodies like solar charging and an automatic backlight.

The thermometer and compass are also two unique features if you’re coming from a regular G-Shock that doesn’t have these.

I cannot express enough how well this thing fits on my wrist, and I’m glad I did not go with the Rangeman. There’s something about this design that just feels right. The hard buttons do not bother me, and it has been getting more wrist time, including at my work, since the time I’ve bought it.

This thing is almost the perfect watch, and the only major thing this one doesn’t have is the multi-band radio reception, so the time may need to be synced every now and then to bring it back to the second accuracy.

## Intro

Not all Android phones are created equal, and the UniHertz Titan 2 is definitely in a league of its own. Further to my detailed review of the Titan 2 in the last video, here are 10 tips, tricks, & quirks about this masterpiece that you may or may not be knowing.

## 01: Mini-Mode

Most Android apps aren’t designed for square screens, for which, just as BlackBerry did, UniHertz has also provided a Mini-Mode, that you can toggle from the notification toggles. You can alternatively also assign it to one of the shortcut keys, so that will save you some time and effort while working with apps that do not play well with the square screen.

## 02: Swap Top Row Keys

The Titan 2 has an additional fourth row over the keyboard, and what you may not know is that some of the keys can be swapped from the software, if not from the hardware. These includes the Alt and Shift keys, and Back and Recent keys, so that you could use it like the original Titan with a reversed button layout.

## 03: Customize Keys

You can also customize the rest of the keys on this row, which is the sym key, and the fn key. This takes it a step further, as you can not only assign these to be used as other keys on the keyboard, but also keys that do not exist on the keyboard, like Ctrl and Tab. Also, you can assign shortcuts to more than just the keys for short press, long press, and double press.

## 04: Clean Home Screen - Launching Apps from Keyboard

With the Titan 2, you can have a clean home screen as everything you need to do can be done using keyboard shortcuts. I use Nova Launcher Prime, but you can also do it with the stock launcher, and enjoy your favorite wallpaper without any noise.

## 05: Cursor Assistance - Hidden Feature

The cursor assistance feature isn’t only limited to moving the cursor over text, but also to tap on items on the screen by tapping on the relative sections of the keyboard. You may need some practice to be able to hit at the right position on the screen though.

## 06: Keyboard Backlight without Pressing a Key

If you find it frustrating that the keyboard backlight only comes up when you press a key and not while scrolling over it, you can activate it with a long swipe on the keyboard, and it will do it just that for you, without needing to press a button.

## 07: Battery Charge Thresholds

I used to believe that UniHertz doesn’t let you set battery charge thresholds, but it is indeed there, though hidden next to battery saver settings.

## 08: Call Recording

You can record a call through a keyboard shortcut, without the need of an external app.

## 09: Multiple Users

You can add multiple users to your Titan 2. This is an Android feature, but most manufacturers disable this on their devices, and thankfully, UniHertz chose to keep it.

## 10: Bluetooth Name Separate from Device Name

The Bluetooth name is separate from the device name you assign to your Titan 2. This means you can assign a different name at either places, or if you’d like it to be consistent, you will need to set it at these two places explicitly.

## Conclusion

So these are the 10 tips, tricks, & quirks that I know of. Do share anything else that I may have missed, or something you learned or discovered.

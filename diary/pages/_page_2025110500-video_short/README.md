## Transcript

I often turn the Titan 2 over to notice that I still haven’t utilized the secondary screen.

Now, for some reason, this screen seems to have a little better contrast and even better blacks than the main screen, kind of resembling OLED screens, but that would make no sense, making this secondary screen better than the primary screen, wouldn’t it?

So, what all can you do with this screen? Well, out of the box, of course, there is the clock face, which I think UniHertz grabbed the concept for from their Tick Tock series. But besides that, there’s only brightness adjustment, camera controls, and this cool compass mode.

And then, there are these “other apps”, that you need to configure using the main screen, and we’ll talk about it in a bit.

Not looking at a few clock plates UniHertz has given us, along with the possibility of creating a custom one, you can configure a few behaviors, including this timeout that you can set to “never”, which is something I’m not comfortable with yet.

You can have a notification indicator and choose which applications can use that. Skipping the camera-related options, now we can finally talk about the “other apps”, which UniHertz has specifically called out being for purely entertainment and demo purposes, and I should say, almost every single app I’ve tried running on the secondary screen looks odd in some or the other way. Apart from the lack of resolution, the corners have a little too much of a curve radius, hiding important details. And do not even talk about needing a keyboard back there.

So, overall, unfortunately, I find it merely a gimmick, with maybe a couple of cool tricks. Let me know your thoughts about it, and if there’s anything useful you’ve done with this screen.

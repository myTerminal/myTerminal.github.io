## Transcript

One of the major issues I’ve had with my short experience with automatic watches is the need to set the time before wearing them every single time.

The other one is having to re-adjust the date and day of the week multiple times a day because my watch would think the day ended at noon. It was annoying until I learned how not to do it.

Also, unless your watch has a 24-hour hand, as I’ve seen in some GMT watches, there is no way to tell (neither for you, nor the watch) whether it is midnight or noon.

So here is the method I’ve learned to make sure the watch is in sync with AM and PM in the real world.

1. You should start adjusting the hour hand away from the upper half of the dial.
2. Then set the date one day prior to the current date.
3. Finally, get back to time adjustment mode and move forward in time, passing through what the watch would think of as midnight. When the hour hand passes that area, the watch changes the date, and the day of the week, if available, and that is how you know the next 12 hours would be AM. If you were to do this, let’s say at 07:00 am in the morning, you should be good taking the hour hand to 7. If you were to do this in the afternoon, though, you’d need to keep moving forward in time, passing through 12 again, and then set the appropriate time. Once you’re there, just push the crown back in, and you’re set.

So after I learned this neat trick, I do not need to worry about the day switch at noon anymore. Let me know if you do it the same way or in some other way.

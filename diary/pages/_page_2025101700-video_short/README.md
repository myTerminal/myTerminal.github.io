## Transcript

Within my watch collection across genres, the Mudman GW-9300 is my go-to watch, as it’s just perfect to me in every single way. However, there is another similar G-Shock that is known to be even better in the same areas. So, sooner than later, I picked up this highly appraised Mudman G-9000.

I’ve heard a lot about the fit on this Mudman, and it is indeed comfortable, but to me, it still doesn’t dethrone the GW-9300. I’m not sure if that’s the carbon-fibre reinforced strap, as I do not remember these to be that better than the regular resin one on the international version.

It is much compact and lighter in comparison, and much of that could also be from the fact that it misses several things like the compass and the thermometer. It does have these double hooks like the other few G-Shocks, including its spiritual twin, the GW-M850.

This may be my best display on a G-Shock yet, with this contrast and viewing angles, maybe even better than the G-7700? One thing that is always talked about for this model is the harder-to-press buttons, and I should say, these are indeed really hard to press, much more than the GW-9300, which is already harder than all the other G-Shocks I’ve tried, and that is to say something!

It has dual 1000-hour stopwatches, unlike the single one on G-7700, and the first one has the familiar countdown feature like the G-7700 and the Rally GW-M850. There is only one timer (unlike the two on the G-7700), but it is special as well, such that it has auto-repeat with progress beeper.

Let’s talk about that unique feature that I remember having seen in only one other G-Shock, but do not seem to remember in which one, that is the dual illumination. It not only illuminates the screen, but also the text outside the screen. This illumination is also longer than usual, and instead of 1.5 and 3 seconds, you can choose between 3 and 5 seconds.

There is Auto-EL backlighting and also flashing alerts that I’m not comfortable with on a watch that doesn’t have solar charging, and the Auto-EL gets disabled automatically after 6 hours from when it is enabled, to preserve battery life.

More than the absence of Multiband radio reception, I miss solar charging on this one. I’m also really curious about how much more complex a battery change would be on this one, given the extra mud-resistance.

Overall, it’s a nice G-Shock, and maybe I could have appreciated it better had I tried it before experiencing some of my other G-Shocks, to be specific, the GW-9300 and the G-7700.  I may hold on to this one for a while, or maybe let it go to someone who appreciates it more, while I keep an eye out for a G-7900.

## Transcript

As I absolutely loved the Mudman 9300, and I could only keep one for myself and pass the other one to a different owner, I was pretty confused as to whether I’d keep the international version in a significantly better condition, or keep the Japanese version with all those abuse marks. I eventually decided to sell off the international version that came along with the complete package, and keep the Japanese version that only arrived as the watch itself.

So then, given how beaten up this thing was, I still had two options:

1. Keep it the way it was and treat it as a beater watch, OR
2. Try to restore it the way I do for my ThinkPads

The replacement parts on this one are pretty expensive and often not available for purchase anymore. Take, for example, these straps that are worth more than how much I paid for this watch itself! But I could find a brand new top shell that was advertised as a genuine replacement piece. Thankfully, replacing it only meant opening up eight screws and putting the new one in, and then the watch was pretty much new when you look at it from the front, and ignore the scratches on the crystal.

I’ll still hold on to the beaten-up shell, for harsher conditions like, yes, you got it right, international trips passing through airport security, and I’ll feel almost nothing throwing it in those filthy trays, bumping each other on the conveyor belt.

## Transcript

Do you remember the good old days, when cellphones used to make you happy? Now, it’s all AI interfaces, and I have been having a hard time connecting to or calling them truly mine, at least for a few years.

So one could either:

1. Buy a mid-budget mobile phone that misses basic features like wireless charging
2. Spend $600 to $800 to get a “flagship” and see it getting out of support and outdated in barely two years
3. Do not spend anything, and get the most entry-level flagship phone from a mobile service provider for free, get locked in their two to three-year contract, forget about even unlocking the bootloader, and eventually trade it in for a newer entry-level flagship after the end of the contract

I’m not even talking about the $1300 to $1800 super-flagships that have a similar fate at the end of two to three years.

I mean, why can’t I buy a phone that I can use for years to come without facing deprecated OS support, or even something that makes me happy, at least as much as a $30 Casio or a $50 ThinkPad?

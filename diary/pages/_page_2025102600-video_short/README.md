## Transcript

I had the opportunity to add another automatic watch to my collection, and this time, from yet another microbrand. This one’s a homage to the Seiko 6105 from 1979, also known as the Captain Willard. This particular variant has something that the Seiko did not have.

There are all the standard diver watch features here, including a screw-down crown, unidirectional rotating stainless steel bezel, lume for hands and markers, and 200 meters of water resistance.

It comes with a solid steel bracelet, a double push-button folder-over clasp with micro-adjustments, and, as people say, this isn’t the best metal bracelet out there. Maybe my bar is too low, and to me, it’s OK, and I’d say that without even considering how affordable this watch is. I like how it also came with an extra nato strap and this additional strap that I do not know what to do with, and this tool, just like the San Martin.

Meanwhile, I forgot to mention earlier how the spring-bar removal tool that came with the San Martin is awesome. It helped me remove the straps of the G-Shock GW-6900, unlike the other tools I’ve used before.

Anyway, coming back to this watch, the only major attraction is the dial, which is a huge departure from my other automatics. The color scheme isn’t the most legible to check the time. It may not be a looker as my Phoibos, but I think I do not have a reason to complain about the overall package.

I switched out the metal straps with these aftermarket leather-like ones, and I think that adds a little bit of contrasts to the watch, which is how I like it. Let me know what you think.

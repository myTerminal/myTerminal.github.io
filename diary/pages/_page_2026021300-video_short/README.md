While preparing the ThinkPad T61 for a new home, I thought to myself, why not restore this one as well with Windows XP using a recovery media?

As a recap, what we have with us is a ThinkPad T61 14.1” widescreen model with a WXGA (1280x800) screen. The CPU was upgraded to an Intel Core 2 Duo T9500, and I dropped back from 8GB to 4GB RAM, and a 256GB SATA III SSD.

The recovery discs I found for the T61 were different. Here, we have a CD to boot from, and all the rest on a DVD, so that involves much fewer disc changes this time. This is another of those examples showing how the move from T60 to T61 was bigger than you’d think. I invested in a set of blank DVDs and created the set using my T440p this time as well. You start by booting from the CD and following a similar process through prompts, eventually swapping in the DVD.

When it was all ready, I tried out a few video games on this one as well, but as the T60 was already running everything I tried pretty smoothly, the only major difference I found was the wider screen. Having said that, this wasn’t a technical benchmark test, so anything quantitative would definitely prove that this machine would run circles around the T60.

With this, this ThinkPad T61 is ready for its new home as well, saved from being thrown away as e-waste, and prepared for many more adventures to come.

## Transcript

Don’t you dare think, that this G-Shock is just the same as any other G-Shock you’ve seen on this channel. Actually, I was looking for a G-Shock G-7800, but as none of the examples on sale, at least the ones in reasonably usable condition, are affordable, I found this G-7700 that had some of the cool features that are hard to find as well, including the display contrast adjustment.

Design-wise, the display is extremely clear and looks great on the round face. The styling reminds me of the Rally G-Shock GW-M850 I had a while ago, and why wouldn’t it, as this is a motorsport-focused G-Shock as well. A very similar color scheme, light-weightedness, texture, fit, etc., all remind me how difficult it was to force myself to sell the GW-M850, and look what we have here! I do not understand the reason for these 12 hand markers, but I guess they look good.

This one doesn’t have a radio time-sync, nor solar charging, and only works with a regular CR2025, but has all the standard features of a good G-Shock, including but not limited to 5 alarms, world time, auto-EL backlight, etc. But here is where the similarities with other G-Shocks end, and the special features start, most of which you may not be able to find in any other Casio out there.

There are three lines of seven-segment digits, and with that, this thing allows you to view three time zones simultaneously. There is also an additional dot-matrix display that comes with a few neat tricks. With all the extra digits on the screen, it also shows you the week number, elapsed, and remaining days until the end of the year, which may not be helpful for everyone.

The stopwatch has a little more precision than your standard Casio and has indicators for lap times, with a special arrangement of a pair of red and green LEDs, along with an animated countdown before the timer starts. It also has a recall mode where you can review up to 99 lap times.

It has a pair of 100-hour timers, along with a feature of interval timing, such that, along with an auto-repeat feature, one could also set some interval between those repeats.

The alarm mode also has a few goodies, where every alarm could be turned into a one-time, daily, weekend, or weekday alarm, similar to that in the GD-350.

I’m sure I did short sell the features in these modes, but I guess there could be a dedicated video covering these. Finally, let’s take a look at how the alarm goes off here.

Overall, with all the G-Shocks that have come and gone, I found another cool one. And while I continue to look for a decent enough example of the G-7800, this one should be enough to stretch my G-Shock capability list further by a couple of points.

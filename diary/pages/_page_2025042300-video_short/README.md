## Transcript

This isn’t your regular digital G-Shock, nor the legendary CasiOak that everyone talks about. I didn’t even know this model existed before getting my hands on this example. It has an analog-digital display and hosts a lot of features you wouldn’t expect in such a compact package.

This particular variant is almost entirely black, except for this shiny blue bezel ring, which I kind of like. The premium-looking dial hides the solar cells as this one’s Solar as well as multi-band reception capable. The three circular digital displays are tiny and unusable, and this one has a negative display that I’m not a fan of. You can barely see them in bright conditions, and even when you trigger the LED light, it only partially illuminates the analog dial and not the digital displays, so you literally cannot use them at night. The lume is good, and that includes the hands as well as the hour markers, unlike on the CasiOaks.

It has all the standard G-Shock features, including world time, stopwatch, timer,  5 alarms with hourly beep signals, auto-LED illumination, battery level indication, and the obvious hand-shift feature that moves the hands away when you’re working with the digital screens.

Many people seem to have a complaint about how the digital screens aren’t usable neither in bright nor dark conditions, but given how compact it is, fitting comfortably on smaller wrists like mine, and how the design doesn’t shout G-Shock making it wearable at more occasions, I’ll add it to my collection.

## Transcript

So, the channel doubled in its fifth year, and we all learned a lot from each other. I’d start by saying, thank you for tuning in and providing your help, suggestions, and feedback. Also, that reminds me of my reason for starting this channel, and that was partly to document and share my learning with friends and strangers on the web alike, and, more importantly, to learn from you through your questions, comments, and suggestions.

For the coming year, I plan to make some changes. As I restructure my priorities and learning, I’ll try to bring as much as I can to this channel while also following my theme for the next year, which is to organize, optimize, and document. I plan to cover some deeper topics through a couple of long-running series. There will, of course, be seemingly random outliers like a watch review here and there, but the rest of it will be focused on Linux, Emacs, and open-source software, computing (hopefully getting my hands on a Tuxedo or System 76 machine), productivity tools, some Web 3.0, and, how can I forget AI!

With all that is going on in the world right now, be safe out there, and take care. See you next year!

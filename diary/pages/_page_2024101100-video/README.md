## Intro

I'm not an expert on [Chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/), but I did get my hands on a couple of them in the last few years. And then I had the privilege of trying a [Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadc/thinkpad-c13-yoga-chromebook-enterprise/22tpc13c3y1), and I should say, I was impressed! So here is my quick review of a ThinkPad that I might never own myself.

## Experience with Chromebooks

So the other Chromebooks that I tried earlier were regular Chromebooks. By regular I mean, they weren't ThinkPads. I know certain ThinkPads have a bad name and people keep saying how they're not worthy of the label, but this ThinkPad Chromebook actually feels like a ThinkPad. As it goes without saying, this isn't my computer, but still, it wasn't difficult for me to spot the following major differences with just a brief experience with this machine.

## My Short Review

1. **The screen is great**, and that's not only in terms of its 1080p resolution, but also the color reproduction, touchscreen sensitivity, and overall quality. This quality level is new to me in a Chromebook.
2. **It has a ThinkPad keyboard** that's pretty much the same as some of the other regular ThinkPad models I've tried. I'm not talking about the super-premium X1 series, but I'm sure these aren't very far from your typical T or X series ThinkPad.
3. **Speaking of the keyboard, there's also the TrackPoint!** I mean is that for real?
4. **There is a garaged stylus** just like the other regular ThinkPad Yoga models I've used, and everything about it feels exactly the same as the other machines with barely any compromise.
5. **There are two cameras** instead of one, which may be a thing in premium Chromebooks, but I haven't seen anything like this within this price point.
6. **The build quality doesn't feel short** either, and the overall design including the hinge mechanism feels solid.

## Conclusion

I'm sure there's more, but these six features already appear to be pretty convincing to me if I were in the market for a Chromebook and was looking for something like a ThinkPad. I'm not sure an audience like that exists, but again, I'm not an expert in Chromebooks, so you tell me!

## Intro

My [ThinkPad](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/c/laptops/thinkpad) fleet grows and shrinks, and I think it’s time to make some space once again. This time it’s the [X230](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X230.75842.0.html), and I thought I’d make one last video about this machine before I let it go.

## But It’s Just Another ThinkPad!

After having handled almost 50 ThinkPads in the last couple of years, I’ve come a long way with ThinkPads, and these machines mean more to me than I ever thought they would, and more so, a few specific machines like this X230. Every single machine that passes me by gets a new life at a new home, but some have had the honor of staying in the fleet, some longer than the rest. Having said that, you can’t keep all of them, and I think it's time to let the X230 go.

## Why Let it Go?

Back when I purchased the X230, I was looking for a successor to a machine that was already perfect, the [X220](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-ThinkPad-X220-IPS-Subnotebook.55639.0.html). It helped me fill the few gaps that the latter had, especially in terms of screen quality. However, as I acquired other legendary machines like the [T440p](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-ThinkPad-T440p-20AN-006VGE-Notebook.108423.0.html), which (if I can say that) is a machine that I literally custom-built myself, and even non-ThinkPad notebooks like this [Panasonic Toughbook CF-20](https://ruggedbooks.com/products/toughbook-20-mk1-16gb-512gb-4g-0-hours), a few things changed. Firstly, I found these machines exhibiting some of the same features that I liked the most in the X230, and then, my understanding of what works for me better improved even further.

Today, when I compare the X230 with the T440p, I find the latter more usable, albeit with a much larger footprint and more weight. Some of it comes with the lower screen resolution on the X230, but more so, how short the screen feels vertically. Not to say that the [X61s](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd012148-detailed-specifications-thinkpad-x61-x61s) is any better in that regard, but that isn’t a machine I usually step out of the house with, while the [X301](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X301.16099.0.html) is merely a collector’s piece that I prefer not comparing with anything else.

We’ve seen this happen before. I’ve parted ways with the machines that were made redundant by other machines. Similar to how I let the X201 go in favor of the X61s and X230, I guess this is the time to let the X230 go in favor of the X61s and the T440p, except that the T440p is from a different series.

## What Will I Lose?

As much of an all-rounder the X230 is, there are a few things I’d definitely be losing.

Let’s start with the things that I would not be losing. Not talking about the standard ThinkPad goodies like the several USB ports, full-sized ethernet port, 3.5mm audio port, VGA port, and a full-sized SD card reader, the mini DisplayPort is also present in the T440p, the expansion slot is in the X61s, and the wireless switch is there in multiple of these. The form factor, though, the [X1 Nano](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Nano-Laptop-Review-Less-than-1-kg-for-the-Business-Subnotebook-with-LTE.517858.0.html) pretty much provides that, and with a much smaller footprint, a way better screen, and infinitely more computing power.

What I will definitely lose is the mSATA slot, and the dual illumination with the ThinkLight as well as a backlit keyboard.

## Second Thoughts

I’ve sold machines before, but this one’s a little special. Now, don’t look at me for saying that I’m overly attached to a notebook computer. A sportsman gets attached to their bat, a race-driver to their favorite car, and so can a computer enthusiast get emotional about a ThinkPad; and how can you not be about this absolute masterpiece of a machine?

I’ve taken this thing with me to places I haven’t taken the X1 Nano to, and with all the other “better” ThinkPads I’ve had come and go, this one has always been my go-to ThinkPad.

But as I am parting ways with it, I’d really prefer for it to go to an owner who’d at least be able to appreciate it as much as I do. After all, this isn’t just any other X230, but one with maxed-out RAM, an upgraded wireless module, serviced cover hinges, a pair of batteries, a touch of custom pinstripping, and a lot of love and care, at least during my ownership. I’d keep the mSATA drive with me though, just for science.

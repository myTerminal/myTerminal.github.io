## Transcript

I forgot to mention a couple of things in the last video that I later thought I’d add.

Using only one machine for every kind of use has its advantages, where it’s not only cheaper and minimalistic, but also creates a bond between man and machine. You may laugh at me, but ask a biker about how they consider their motorbike as a friend, or even a member of the family. Similarly, even with multiple ThinkPads, I tend to create a personal connection such that each and every one of these has a name signifying some of the machine’s characteristics, and I mostly go with names of celestial objects.

1. The T15g Gen 2 is named “Titan”, the largest moon of Saturn, the second largest in our solar system.
2. The X1 Extreme Gen 3 is named “Excelsior”.
3. The X1 Nano Gen 1 is named “Mimas”, the smallest moon of Saturn.
4. The T440p is named “Rhea”, the second-largest moon on Saturn.
5. The X230 is named “Triton”, the largest moon of Neptune.
6. The X301 is named “Proteus”, the second-largest moon of Neptune.
7. The X61s is named “Miranda”, not after the character from the Mass Effect Trilogy, but after the smallest moon of Uranus.

And there have been other names like Ganymede, Europa, Skylon, Polaris, and many more, but you get the idea. So yes, what appears like simply buying old ThinkPads is definitely much more than that, and these little masterpieces also hold quite a lot of sentimental value.

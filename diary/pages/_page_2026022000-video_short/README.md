## Transcript

I’ve used Evernote, DropBox Paper, Dynalist, and many more, but what I use now is Logseq, along with Emacs, of course! Logseq comes with a lot more goodies as compared to the competition like Obsidian, some of which include its open-source code-base so I can use it at work without getting in trouble, native org-mode support so that Emacs would still be in picture, block-level atomicity such that not everything is a page, datalog query engine that would remind you of Lisp while creating “views” into your data, a config file that is written in EDN (which is a subset of Clojure), a better git integration just in case, an Anki-style spaced repetition system that lets you turn anything into a card, closer integration with PDF, a more keyboard-focussed control, and much more.

For me, specifically, I could keep most of what I was already using while improving it with Logseq clients on Linux as well as Android.

Next up will be to find a free and open-source replacement for Notion that would let me work with locally stored plain-text files. To break it to you, I already have a few options in mind.

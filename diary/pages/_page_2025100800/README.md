# Adding a New Tool to My Toolset

If you know me, you know I love tools. Not just using them, but also learning about them, comparing them with others, tinkering with them, optimizing them for my workflow, and at times passing on the redundant ones to someone who might be able to make better use of them. But over the years, I’ve formed this list of things to consider before adopting a new tool in my toolset, and here are some of them:

1. Whatever the tool is helping me with, can it be covered by anything else already existing in my toolset?
2. Would the new tool be focused on a single use, or will it cover multiple uses and potentially replace several other tools?
3. Would this tool be integrated with other elements in the workflow, or would it operate independently?
4. Once adopted, how much wrist/pocket time would it get? Or would it be resting on a desk or a shelf after the first few days of acquisition?
5. How replaceable is this tool from a future perspective? Am I locking myself into a service or platform that will get me tied up too deeply to escape?
6. How much cognitive load does this new tool add to my daily life and workflow?
7. How much maintenance does this new tool need? This also includes maintaining battery charge levels and regular cleaning.
8. What deteriorating elements does this tool come with? A major one among these is often a rechargeable battery that isn’t as easy or cost-effective to replace.
9. What overall value does this new tool add to me? Can I choose not to adopt it?

And, these are just a few of those questions. These do not always turn a “yes” into a “no”, or vice-versa, but they often do help me make a better decision by not overloading my workflow with unnecessary baggage.

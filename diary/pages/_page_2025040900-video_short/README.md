## Transcript

The CasiOak design, or rather platform, gets a legendary status among G-Shock fans and has also attracted outsiders into liking G-Shock by being their first G-Shock watch. However, as these are highly sought after, with so many choices of colors and variants to choose from, I could never get to experience one myself. It is always out of stock, only sold by third-party sellers on platforms like eBay, with often very similar prices for brand-new and used examples.

After months of looking around, I finally have one for myself, and that too a variant that I never thought I’d get. This GA-2110 is what I’d call a spin-off of the original CasioOak design of the 2100 series. It doesn’t come with all the bells and whistles that the later models came with, like solar charging or Bluetooth connectivity, and hence stays very close to the original GA-2100. However, a few differences from the original design are the dual-tone colors, this being a pretty calming color as they call it “Earth Tone”, a slightly heavier and stronger bezel, and these colored plastic buckles like the later models, unlike the metal ones on the original. The glass is super-clear, such that it feels as if nothing is stopping you from touching the dial, and this thing is also one of the lightest watches I’ve had.

Everything is like your standard CasiOak, with only the hands having lume and not the hour markers, but that is something I have on my list, given how easy it is to mod one of these. Overall, I’m super happy with my purchase, and this one is definitely a keeper!

## Transcript

I had never heard of this brand before, but I was looking for something with solar and multi-band radio reception at an affordable price. This brand doesn’t seem to have a good name back in Germany, which is where this thing comes from. It came with Berlin as the home city, and after switching the home time, it took a while for the hands to sweep to the correct position according to US Central Time, not only because how slow the sweep is, or because the hands only move in one direction, but it was like the two hands are connected, so it has to go all around the clock just to get both the hands at a desired position.

So this wristwatch comes with a lot:

1. Solar charging with a power reserve indicator and multi-band reception make it my first atomic watch
2. A Digital stopwatch that gets the job done
3. A second timezone that you can check the time for with the press of a button.

The hands and the hour markers have some lume on them for dark conditions, but there is no backlight.

The bezel doesn’t rotate, and it appears a little too noisy to me. But it’s a full metal case with metal straps, something that I haven’t owned in a very long time.

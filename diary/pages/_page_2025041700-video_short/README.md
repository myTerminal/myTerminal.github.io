## Transcript

The G-Shock GW-2310 takes a proper round shape and form than the five watches we’ve seen in the recent videos. This one comes with all the regular features like world time, 5 alarms with hourly time signals, stopwatch and timer, and a few advanced features like solar charging, multi-band radio reception, auto-EL backlighting, etc.

This one has a dual-tone bezel with a more premium feel and a different strap design that I find better, and I also like the overall look on my wrist.

I also have this stealthy GW-2310FB with me that isn’t as colorful as the other one, and I’d prefer the look of this one over the other. The only problem is, as usual, the negative display and that makes it much less usable, both, during the day and also at night. Even the backlight doesn’t help much and takes the stealth to an extreme where it starts to hinder basic functionality.

Which one would you go with?

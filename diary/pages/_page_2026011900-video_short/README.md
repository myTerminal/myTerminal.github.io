## Transcript

I came across this Chronos Water Ghost in a relatively rare colorway, and this watch is the first of its kind for me in several areas. To start with, it has a PT5000 high-beat movement that produces 8 ticks per second instead of 6, unlike my other automatics. Also, I’ve never had a Cyclops lens on any of my watches before.

With that out of the way, this one is surprisingly similar to the San Martin SN0113W in many areas. The Chronos L6005 usually hosts a glidelock mechanism for micro-adjustments on the strap, similar to the fly adjustment on San Martin, however, my watch didn’t have that for some reason. There are screwed links, an amazing finish and feel, and it is smaller than it looks in pictures, just like the San Martin. This is another of those watches that barely fits my wrist, similar to the San Martin, after the removal of merely two links. The bezel rotation is super smooth, similar to the Citizen Promaster.

Overall, it’s also quite a looker, almost as good as the Phoibos Leviathan, and something that I can forget it’s even on my hand, unlike the Leviathan, which is like pulling a lot of weight around.

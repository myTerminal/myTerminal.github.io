## Transcript

I finally installed macOS on a ThinkPad. I’m kidding!

So as I moved on from Nobara as my secondary Linux distribution for use-cases like the mSATA drive on the T440p, I was looking for something that I hadn’t tried before, and so I came across pearOS. Now given enough time, one can make any Linux distribution look like anything they want, but I learned that pearOS is the closest to macOS right out of the box, as compared to other distributions. I also read about how the installer would sometimes silently wipe out things, so I removed my primary storage drive just to be safe during the installation.

As far as my experience goes, I’d say it would appear from a distance that you are using a black MacBook. The theming is OK, and thanks to the Arch base, you have access to the AUR, but I’d say it’s still far from macOS in terms of polish. There are typos, misalignments, and missing features. Also, I have no idea who this guy is.

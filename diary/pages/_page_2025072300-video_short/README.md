You may have heard from me numerous reasons for buying so many ThinkPads. A typical workflow is to find a model with some unique characteristics that I have never experienced before, to scoring an example at an online auction, having fun restoring it, and often maxing it out with parts, often also pushing it beyond the OEM specs (within reason obviously), covering the entire process in a video or two, and eventually passing it on to the next owner.

That’s all at a high level, and pretty obvious, but there’s definitely more to it than just that. Many of these get added to my fleet, which means that the particular ThinkPad in question means more to me than the others. Also, when a ThinkPad does get added to my fleet, it doesn’t just stay in the corner of the house or on a shelf. I take it with me almost everywhere I go, except for machines like the T15g Gen 2, for obvious reasons. I’ve been seen with all different kinds of ThinkPads, big and small, thin and super bulky, new and old, and that includes my office desk at my day job, public libraries, seats at the water park, and you name it.

So yes, every single ThinkPad brings an experience with it, that I try to live the max out of. Though it may still confuse a “non-believer”, how I like to describe it is that I try to relive a past that I never lived back in the day, if that makes any sense, that is.

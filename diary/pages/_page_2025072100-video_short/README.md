## Transcript

Who doesn’t love a good old classic ThinkPad? Maybe MacBook users? I don’t know!

Anyway, as delightful as these machines are to work on and use, there are a few inconveniences that these sweet little masterpieces bring along. I’ll start with the smallest first.

1. Though enjoyable, these may not be the best tool for most jobs today. You may need to make certain adjustments to your workflow or the tools that you use.
2. You may end up supplementing these with another modern machine for certain tasks, for example, me running Ollama on one of my stronger machines and connecting to the service through this X61s.
3. Not everyone you work or live with will appreciate these as much as you do. Though that shouldn’t technically be a problem, instances when you need to turn your screen over to someone else may not be as smooth as you’d like. It often starts with screen viewing angles. Don’t ask me how I know!
4. Though these machines themselves are cheap, spare parts can be harder to find, and often end up being unreasonably expensive. So that brings in the fear of breaking something that may cost a lot to fix or replace.
5. Certain elements of these machines can never be fixed, for example, this clattering on the display bezel on my X61s, unless you find a donor machine that you do not end up falling in love with, only to have two of these that you need to fix.

I realize these are first world problems, and if you can deal with these, there may be a classic ThinkPad waiting for you to experience computing at its finest. If you cannot, please send these over to people like me, as that will mean nothing less than the world to one of us.

## Transcript

The Kinetic technology intrigues me, but I doubt it would be something I’ll ever go with. On one hand, they promise quartz-like accuracy while also kind of being a mechanical watch, with all that cool technology inside to create the best of both worlds, but on the other hand, there are clear design limitations.

They can only be charged through hand movements, unlike my solar watches, where simply placing them near the window or even below a bright lamp would charge them up to the max in a matter of a few minutes to an hour.

They also do not allow manual winding, like how the automatic or mechanical watches do, so that would mean that unless they’re being used daily, the charge capacitor or the battery will wear out very soon by running out of charge ever so often.

With my current shifting setup, I may not be able to wear the same watch even as often as every other day, and hence I may need to keep away from owning one. Meanwhile, there’s plenty to learn and explore from automatic watches.

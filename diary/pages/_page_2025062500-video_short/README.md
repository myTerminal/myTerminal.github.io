## Transcript

So, I have three X-Series ThinkPads in my fleet at the moment, so I thought I’d put the X13 Gen 3 next to each one of these for a super-quick comparison.

### X301

I don’t even consider the X301 a member of the X-series. It was meant to be one of those in the X1 lineup. Besides, as much as I love it, with computing power even less than that of the X61s, I do not consider it worthy enough to enter any comparison.

### X230

I know I’ll get a lot of flak for saying this, but the X230 feels a “little” similar to the X13 Gen 3. Let me explain…

These two are exactly a decade apart in age, and we’ve lost most of what enthusiasts loved in a ThinkPad, but the keyboard on the X13 Gen 3 is still not that bad, it retains more ports than most notebooks of its size, and to me, feels like a drop-in replacement for an X230 user if they were to jump 10 years forward in time in search for something modern.

### X61s

The comparisons get exciting as the X13 Gen 3 moves 5 more years back, looking at its ancestor, the X61s. There is practically nothing common between these two machines, and it’s interesting how computer hardware technology has evolved in merely a decade and a half. If you think 15 years is a lot of time, don’t get me started on how I think 2010 was just yesterday.

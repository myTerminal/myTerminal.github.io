## Transcript

### Intro

As an extension to the 10 quirks I shared in the last video, here are 12 more.

### 01: Dimensions Are Uncomfortable

Starting with a nitpick, the dimensions, especially after coming from a Flip phone, are at times overwhelming to me. Again, this is just a nitpick, and I’m not complaining, at least not yet.

### 02: Screen Temperature

Moving on to the screen, the color temperature is warmer than I’ve seen elsewhere. Thankfully, there is more than just that you can adjust to turn it to your liking.

### 03: Full Screen Doesn’t Work

As it goes without saying, switching to full screen while watching a video is not useful. The YouTube app doesn’t allow it, but NewPipe rotates the screen orientation by at least turning the phone into landscape mode, if not the screen.

### 04: Split Screen May Not Work

The screen isn’t tall enough for split screen, but at least the keyboard doesn’t show up messing with the split. This may or may not be useful to you.

### 05: Linking Keyboard Backlight to Screen Timeout

I learned that you can kind of pair the keyboard backlight with the screen backlight by choosing the last option in the timeout settings.

### 06: Navigation Buttons

Three of the buttons in the top row take the place of what would otherwise be the soft navigation buttons. However, if you care, the order of these three is a little unusual.

### 07: Buttons May Be Harder than the Passport

After a few days of using it, I think the keyboard buttons may be harder to press than those on the BlackBerry Passport. As I do not have the Passport anymore, it’s just a speculation.

### 08: Keyboard Layout

You can switch keyboard layouts to something other than QWERTY. You just need to keep holding this globe icon, select an additional entry or more, and then later, toggle through them by simply tapping on the globe icon again.

### 09: Cool Cursor Control with Selection & Copy/Paste

If the keyboard-driven cursor control isn’t for you, there is a much more convenient one hidden here. It also contains selection and clipboard features.

### 10: Clipboard

Speaking of the clipboard, this thing stores almost an infinite number of clipboard entries indefinitely, until you clear them manually.

### 11: Four Ways to Access Numpad

There are literally four ways to access the numpad. Apart from hitting the “alt” key on the keyboard and using the alphabet keys, you can either use “sym” key once to bring it up, or this key here, and cycle through here if needed, or through a couple of taps here for a calculator-like layout.

### 12: Personal Dictionary

You can also add certain words to your personal dictionary, and optionally assign them trigger words, to minimize your key-pressed.

### Conclusion

So these are twelve more quirks with the UniHertz Titan 2. Please share anything interesting that you know in the comments that I haven’t covered yet.

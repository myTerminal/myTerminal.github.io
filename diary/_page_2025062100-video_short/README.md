## Transcript

So, I conducted a “funny experiment” by taking the ThinkPad T440p with me on a trip, leaving my X1 Nano and smaller ThinkPads at home, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.

1. The dimensions and weight aren’t that bad, especially if you’ve made up your mind.
2. The keyboard is amazing, to the point you’ll feel like typing more than you’d need to.
3. The aftermarket 1080p screen is gorgeous, and though I’ve had the honor to work with much better screens like the one on the X1 Extreme Gen 3 and X1 Nano, something as sharp and accurate as this, on a machine that’s over twelve years old, is indescribably satisfying. 
4. Battery consumption is better than what I expected, and the runtime duration is sufficient, even with the smaller battery. 
5. Heat is also better than that of machines from similar generations, like the X230, and I’m sure much of it comes from the larger chassis, and also because I haven’t upgraded to a quad-core CPU yet.

For someone who’s gotten used to traveling with the X61s, X230, and the X1 Nano, the bag does get noticeably heavy, but for something reasonably capable and a notebook that you can throw around and not worry about, I think the extra effort is worth it. On the plus side, I had more ports on my trip than I could’ve possibly asked for.

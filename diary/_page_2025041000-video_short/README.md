## Transcript

Along with my other CasiOak, here is yet another one, this time for smaller wrists, the GMA-S2100. It turns out it isn’t that small in comparison, but this color does suggest a feminine-friendly design.

A few major differences from the GA-2110 include this “Nature Collection” design that replaces the week hand with a leaf and the colored buttons instead of bare silver like on most G-Shocks. Casio also advertised a double-LED illumination as opposed to the one on the GA-2110 that only uses one.

The rest of the things are exactly the same, except for the smaller dial, of course. But then, the calm and relaxing color choices, that leaf that reminds you of nature every time you look at the dial, this one definitely looks like one of those G-Shock models that would help the non-fans discover the world of G-Shocks.

## Transcript

The G-Shock GD-400 is way different than the GD-350. Not that the latter is small by any means, but this one feels even bulkier, just the way a G-Shock should. These textured straps with a couple of additional G-Shock emblems, these bold color accents, the bull-bar, and raised protection around the buttons all contribute to the loud design of this watch. We do not have the wings anymore, nor the vibration alerts, and it runs on a regular battery.

Along with the regular G-Shock features, it also carries a lot of goodies from the GD-350, like flashing alerts, auto-LED backlight, and here, the buzzer is used much more, just as your regular G-Shock, which also includes the hourly chimes, and key-presses, both of which are absent on the GD-350. It also allows checking the time of four selected world cities at a glance, as opposed to only one in most other G-Shocks.

My only two gripes with this watch are the negative display, which is way less readable, and the overall design, which is not as tactical as the GD-350. It isn’t a bad watch by any means, and it’s better in many areas, but I prefer the GD-350.

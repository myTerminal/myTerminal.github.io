## Transcript

Experiencing tens of G-Shocks in the last few weeks has helped me develop a clear picture of my ideal G-Shock.

1. I’ve re-realized that I don’t like the feel of metallic straps and find resin straps or even other softer materials much comfortable to wear. Not to mention the clattering of those metallic links.
2. Digital watches are cute, but I find analog hands easier to read time on, so an analog+digital dial is ideal.
3. I like to have some contrast on the dial so that reading information would be quick and easy, even in low-light conditions, without needing to use the backlight.
4. I like flat cases so that they don’t stick out of the wrist. I don’t mind making an exception for the GD-350 and a few other watches of mine.
5. I prefer the case to be not too small, but more importantly, not too huge, again with the exception for a few watches.
6. A watch without solar charging now gives me battery anxiety, so that is definitely a must-have in my ideal G-Shock, though I wasn’t even aware something like that existed before I dived into the world of G-Shocks.
7. I don’t care much about the multi-band radio reception, though having several of these in the same room with the hourly signal turned ON clearly demonstrates the need for a regular time-sync. Also, I’d prefer radio sync anyday over Bluetooth sync with a smartphone.

What are your preferences for a perfect G-Shock, or any wristwatch in general?

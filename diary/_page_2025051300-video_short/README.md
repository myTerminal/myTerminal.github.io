## Transcript

While looking for an analog G-Shock from the Master of G collection, I came across this GravityMaster that was different. This example was golden, which is something I’ve been running away from in wristwatches, but it looked OK on this particular watch. The golden elements here weren’t that golden, and the design was interesting.

This G-Shock felt more premium in person than it looked in pictures, and certainly more than any other G-Shock I had tried before, and that was not only from the looks and finish, but in other elements like the buttons.

Apart from the regular Casio modes like the world time, stopwatch, timer, and alarms, this one also came with two sensors, a thermometer, and a compass.

We still haven't talked about the three striking features of this watch:

1. The super illuminator is actually super bright
2. The negative display is one of the best I’ve seen on a Casio
3. And you can see the current time of one more selected city alongside your home city, no matter which mode you are in, as you have a dedicated sub-dial for that

And, the watch wears pretty comfortably on the wrist, such that, along with the rest of the package, it makes it suitable for formal occasions as well.

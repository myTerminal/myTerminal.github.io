# Meet My (Real) First Casio: Forester

## Intro

So I pretty much lied in the last video by calling the DW-290 my first [Casio](https://www.casio.com). As a matter of fact, I took my time to decide on that watch. Meanwhile, one decision was easy, and that was to pick up this [Casio Forester](https://www.casio.com/us/watches/casio/product.FT-500WC-5BV) as a beater watch that I could wear anywhere I wanted.

## The Forester

This isn’t the most expensive watch out there, nor does it have all the features other watches have. However, just look at this thing! Can you make a watch look any better, especially at this price point? That legible dial with that amazingly attractive color scheme with a date window, a light function, and 100 meters of water resistance is just too much for such a tiny package.

Among the three choices of colors, I chose brown, which to me is the best one out of the three.

## What it Isn’t

Now as it goes without saying, this watch isn’t nearly as full of features as the [DW-290](https://www.casio.com/us/watches/casio/product.DW-290-1V), but for what it provides, it puts a smile on my face every single time I wear it on my wrist.

## A Small Issue

One issue with a watch like this can be trying to get it to change the date correctly on long or short months, and also at midnight instead of noon. This is a big departure from using a smartwatch that cannot possibly go wrong with its time and date feature, though you have to wait for minutes for it to start up after being turned OFF.

## Conclusion

Overall, I’d say that I couldn’t have been happier with a watch as much as I have been with this Casio Forester. I’d even go on to say that these are probably the best 20 dollars I’ve spent on anything I remember.

## Outro

That's all I have for this video, and thanks for watching it to the end. May the maker watch over you. See you in the next video! And yes, "Free Palestine!".

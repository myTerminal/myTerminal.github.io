## Transcript

So I finally got my hands on a MudMaster, or rather, this MudMaster got itself on my hands. See what I did there?

This GWG-2000 is my first ABC watch, which, if you know, means a triple sensor with Altimeter, Barometer, and Compass. Along with these three, we also have the thermometer, and I found it to be more accurate than the Mudman.

If you’ve been even a little aware of G-Shocks, and more specifically the Master of G collection, this watch doesn’t need an introduction. It’s the flagship MudMaster, the successor of GWG-1000, which is a model I had been avoiding for a long time, with skepticism about the fit on my slender wrist. This one though, the internet people said was smaller, and I was surprised how well it did fit on my wrist, except that it appeared chunky, and yes, it is my heaviest G-Shock yet. But even then, there’s no overhang, unlike the much smaller GW-6900.

There are too many modes to cycle through, with the Barometer, Thermometer, and a few others added to the list, while the Compass and Altimeter have their dedicated buttons.

There’s a lot of bling on this watch, which I do not mind much, and the lume is crazy, not only in terms of how bright it is and how long it stays in the dark, but also in terms of how little light it needs to get charged. The lower end of the number 6 stays lit for a while, if at all you trigger the backlight even once. The negative display is awesome, even better than the GravityMaster.

I barely ever need to watch tutorial videos for a G-Shock, given how similar they usually are in terms of control. However, for the GWG-2000, I had to watch long tutorials from WatchGeek to learn how to change things beyond alarms and hourly signals, as this watch is different!

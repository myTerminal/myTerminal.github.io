## Transcript

The G-Shock GD-350 is unique in many areas, at least among the G-Shocks I’ve seen up to this point:

1. It has a huge screen, with gigantic numbering, and that special tinting on the date line, and dual-LED backlight.
2. It works with a full-sized CR 2032 battery to support its power-hungry features.
3. It has a thick strap, double strap hooks, and these wings like other more expensive G-Shocks.

And these aren’t the only things that make it unique. Though not powered by Solar, this model prefers to use either vibration or flashing backlight as signals over buzzer beeps. As a matter of fact, there are only a couple of instances when the beep is even used, and as far as I’ve found, only while operating the timer, which is another of the unique features as there’s a dedicated button to start a timer from any screen. However, you need to get into the timer mode to pause or reset the timer.

It also has all the other standard features you get with a typical digital G-Shock, which includes auto-calendar, world time, five alarms, etc.

At the end of the day, I do not know what I like the most about this watch: the vibration feature, a super-bright double LED illumination with flashing alerts, a dedicated timer button, or just this overall design that you just can’t stop looking at. Even though this one seems to have seen some use, I still find it worthy enough to be added to my collection.

## Transcript

Have you noticed that a certain notebook computer feels better to hold than the other?

To me, that machine is the ThinkPad X301, where everything including the sizing, proportions, weight, and tapered edges is just perfect! It gets even better when just before you hold it, you get to hear this sweet sound of the latch clicking in place just as it should!

The only other machine Iâ€™ve felt this is the ThinkPad T420s, which is one of the only two s-variant T-series models (along with the T430s) that have been designed differently than the neighboring generations.

Is there such a notebook that you prefer holding over the other?

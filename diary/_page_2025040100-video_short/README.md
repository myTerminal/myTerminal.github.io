## Transcript

Earlier, you’ve seen me testing, restoring, and reviewing ThinkPads and other notebooks and computers. These kinds of videos aren’t going anywhere, and in fact, there are a few planned for the future. However, in the upcoming videos, you’ll see me do just that, but with wristwatches. These will be mostly G-Shocks, a line-up I find very similar to ThinkPads.

I won’t be covering these watches in detail, as we already have a lot of such information on the internet. Instead, I’ll just be talking about their unique characteristics, add a few personal comments and opinions, and maybe compare them to other similar watches. I plan to make it quick and informative, so are you excited? Because I certainly am, so see you in the upcoming videos!

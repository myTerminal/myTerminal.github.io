## Transcript

After having three automatics in my collection, I was still looking to scratch the itch for a Seiko, given all the craze I could come across on the internet. My problems with Seiko were several. Call me a nitpicker, but the modern Seiko 5s didnâ€™t impress me, and the older models like the SKX made no sense for the money. Some interesting models like this FrankenMonster were expensive, and mint condition models were a little too expensive.

I had been particularly avoiding Timex as a brand, given its lesser reputation than the Japanese brands, and with Casio covered and Seiko out of the question, I came across this Citizen diver that I found pretty attractive. Not only was it a close competition to the SKX, but there was something else with this particular variant that was a strong selling point for me.

The Citizen ProMaster NY0040-09W is an older Citizen from 1997, one that cannot match the modern automatic movements I have in the Berny, San Martin, and the Phoibos, but not only do I like the overall design including the dial, the markers, the hands much more than the SKX, as I had been seeing from the pictures, I also loved the relatively rare 8-o-clock position crown. Finally, let me show you that one thing that totally had me: this full lume that not only illuminates the hands and the markers, but literally the entire face, including the dial! Now tell me, how cool is that!

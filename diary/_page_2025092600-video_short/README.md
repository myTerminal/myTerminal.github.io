## Transcript

My recently acquired automatic watches, at least most of them, had straps that I didn’t find suitable to wear, so I decided to swap those out for aftermarket straps.

To start with, I replaced the thick strap on my Berny with one similar to the one I had on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, as I loved the convenience of the magnetic latch. These are too soft, thin, and scarily flexible, especially for a heavy watch like this one. I hope these will hold until I decide to swap them out with something better or sell the watch itself.

Then, I replaced the super-thick straps on the Phoibos Leviathan. At first, I thought I’d get a metal bracelet, but then, as I’m not a fan of those, I decided to go with these leather-like ones. Getting these out was pretty simple, as the factory ones were quick-release. Getting the new ones in was a little harder than I thought, and I was worried I’d damage the straps more than I did I’d scratch the lugs. These may not be the best straps for this monster, but hey, I’m trying what works for me, and I can replace these any time I want in the future. Besides, the metal bracelet is still there, and I might as well try it on this one someday.

Finally, I replaced the stock straps on the Citizen ProMaster. This one didn’t have the quick-release mechanism as the Leviathan, nor was it as soft as the one on the Berny, and hence it took me a couple of attempts. I wasn’t worried about the stock straps, as I didn’t like them as much as I did for the other two watches. Once these were out, getting the aftermarket straps was pretty straightforward. And, I couldn’t be happier seeing how well this color goes with the full lume face.

I may have spoiled the overall feel of the watches with these cheaper straps, but I guess it’s just a start. Also, I left the San Martin with the factory straps as they are awesome, and fit well with the rest of the watch. Let me know what you think about these changes or if you think I could or should have tried something else.

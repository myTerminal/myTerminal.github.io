## Transcript

After exactly 29 wristwatches, I finally got my hands on an automatic watch. The Berny AM139M is a homage to a watch that’s about a hundred times more expensive, but I have nothing to complain here, at least for my first one.

Apart from the bidirectional inner rotate bezel, a Miyota 8205 self-winding movement with manual-winding and hacking, the day and date display at 3 o’clock, a sapphire crystal both on front and the exhibition case back, 200M water resistance, there are several other things I like.

Some of them are dual screw-down crowns, amazing contrast on the dial, a pretty strong lume on the hands and the markers, and super comfortable strap, which in fact is the softest I’ve seen in any wristwatch till this point. All this for a price much less than the Seiko’s I had been eyeing on for a while.

This one’s also my heaviest wristwatch yet, even heavier than the G-Shock GWG-2000. I literally couldn’t have been any happier with my first automatic watch that I never thought I’d ever be interested in getting.

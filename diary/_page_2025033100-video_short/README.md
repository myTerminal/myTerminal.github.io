## Transcript

Most of us have had “buy it for life” experiences, and there are a few such brands or sub-brands in pretty much every consumable product genre. I knew a few like the ThinkPads that can potentially outlive the owner, Subaru and Toyota for a similar reputation in the automobile industry, and Logitech in computer peripherals (like this almost 12-year-old M185 that refuses to die). Recently, I discovered another, which is Casio, in wristwatches.

I also found that G-Shock’s are just another level as these things are built to last a very very long time.

During my recent deep dive into the world of wristwatches, I learned about terms like wrist-check, watch logs, state-of-the-collection, and much more. I came across a cult where people collect, enjoy, share, and celebrate their wristwatches, just as some of us do with our ThinkPads.

There is also a huge aftermarket of parts and mods that one could use to further customize and subjectively improve their watch beyond Casio’s original design.

The way we ThinkPad-ers can go on and on about a machine that few people think is way beyond outdated, these people are geeky down to details like whether the countdown timer on their decades-old digital watch allows auto-repeat.

Am I about to join a cult I did not even know existed? Stay tuned, and we’ll find that out together in the next video.

## Transcript

Certain watches, such as the Casio Forester, are like love at first sight. Othersâ€¦ they need a little getting used to, a good example is the G-Shock GW-6900. Finally, some watches are just confusing, like the 2100 series. I could never understand the craze about those, for how people just swore by them, even after several spiritual successors were introduced.

However, there could be that one variant, or maybe two, that would just feel right, like this super-calming GA-2110 that could not have been more subtle, while being based on the exact platform as its siblings with massively different looks and appeal, becoming a hurdle for someone like me from getting into it.

Variants of the same watch (be it with different material or colors) could make a bigger difference than the model itself. For example, if the GD-400 that we saw in one of the earlier videos were to have a positive display, I would have had a vastly different experience and impression of it.

At the end of the day, whether the watch be analog or digital, feature-full or feature-less, cheap or expensive, compact or huge, none of that makes it better than the other. What does matter is which one your hand reaches out to when you need to step out of the house.

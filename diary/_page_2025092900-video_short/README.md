## Transcript

Out of all the G-Shocks in my collection, this Mudman GW-9300 is my favorite. And, I should say, after using a few automatic watches, I’ve started to appreciate the Mudman even more. I’ve always been a fan of this face since the first time I came across it while I was considering the Rangeman GW-9400, and with this fit, for how it literally wraps around the wrist, it feels like a part of the body. But, this video isn’t about the Mudman, so I’ll leave it there.

As none of my automatics are accurate, and keep drifting by several seconds a day, and the fact that I have to make adjustments, specifically for the date and at times the day of the week, not only when I pick it up after a few days, but also multiple times during the day I’m wearing these, this digital solar watch would practically never stop working, nor would it lose accuracy as it syncs the time almost every night, so it’s like put it on and never having to worry about it.

I find it fascinating how these two completely different watches are built to do the same thing, and that is to show time, except that the Mudman also has a few other tricks up its sleeves, like the compass and the thermometer, along with the other standard digital watch functions, and it’s not even the most featureful watch in my collection, as the Mudmaster stares at me from a corner there. It is cool to be able to set a timer while waiting in a queue, and also be notified when it’s safe to drop off a the meeting at the end of the hour. Having said that, that’s pretty much it, and though these automatics may feel lacking functionality, I’d even go on to say that we do not need these to show us the time either, given how we’re surrounded with digital clocks around us in all forms and sizes anyway. At the end, and I say this in line with my ongoing transition to form over function, a watch is just a companion, one that could mean more to you even than a cellphone, which you can look at without risking the tens of lives around you when you’re sitting at the driver’s seat in your car.

Alright, that’s too much ranting for today, and let me know what you think.

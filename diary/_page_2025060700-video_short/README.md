## Transcript

If you’ve seen my ThinkPad X230, it has received quite a few upgrades, some of which are:

- 512GB SATA III solid-state storage
- 16GB DDR3 RAM
- a 6-cell aftermarket battery

and more…

What still stays original is:

- The IPS HD screen at 768p
- The infamous chicklet keyboard
- The barrel charging connector

That leaves us with one pretty straightforward thing that I never felt the need to do, which is adding another storage drive through the mSATA slot inside.

I used my first ever mSATA drive and it all went like a breeze. I installed Nobara Linux on it, and this masterpiece now has dual personalities.

BTW, I love Nobara and regret ignoring it for all this time. This also means you’ll most likely see more of it in my future videos.

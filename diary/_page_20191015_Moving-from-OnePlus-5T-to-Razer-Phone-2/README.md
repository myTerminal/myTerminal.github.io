# Moving from OnePlus 5T to Razer Phone 2

Stepping into the OnePlus universe was never my first choice. After facing numerous software-related issues on my [BlackBerry Passport Silver Edition](https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_launches_the_passport_silver_edition_out_today-news-13389.php) which I paid $700 for, the kind of phone I wanted to switch to didn't quite exist. While using my BlackBerry, for a first few weeks I believed that I was out of the Android ecosystem but it soon turned out that I was using one without even realizing ([BlackBerry 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_10) was still [Android](https://www.android.com) underneath), and that too a deprecated one. One possible solution to the problem was to switch to an affordable developer-centric Android device and after some struggle to find a not-so-mainstream device, it ended up being a [OnePlus 5T](https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-5t). It was a pretty rare-ish phone in the US back then (and its successors still are today) and looked down at for not being an [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone) or a [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy), which is like the standard for phones over here. I ordered the higher-end model with 128GBs of internal storage and 8GBs of RAM on day one.

If I'd say that the phone wasn't good, it would be a straight-up lie: the phone was phenomenal. Every single thing about the phone felt the best and it left me with nothing to complain about. I did get reactions from iPhone users at my workplace, but people who looked at the phone complimented it for it's tall 18:9 (almost edge-to-edge) AMOLED screen. But like all the other phones that I used in the last sixteen years (since my [Panasonic](https://www.gsmarena.com/panasonic_gd92-125.php) in early 2004), this one was not supposed to be the last.

I made an unplanned switch to [Razer Phone 2](https://www.razer.com/mobile/razer-phone-2) in the last week in August 2019 and I wouldn't call it an upgrade (probably a 'sidegrade', if that were a word?).

## What I gained

Below are the improvements I found in 'Aura' (codename for Razer Phone 2) when comparing it to the 'dumpling' (codename for OnePlus 5T)

- Higher-resolution (2560 x 1440) screen with the highest refresh rate (120Hz) in the industry
- [Razer Chroma](https://www.razer.com/mobile/razer-phone-2) logo with customizable colors and patterns
- Dolby certified 'real' dual stereo speakers that were rated 'the best' in the industry back when it was released
- Expandable storage once again
- Wireless charging, first time for me
- A slightly updated chipset, that performs better than the dumpling
- Some cool tweaks by Razer in the stock ROM without any significant bloat

## What I lost

On the flip side, below are the shortcomings I discovered within the first week of using the phone

- No [AMOLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED) display: I'm back to an [IPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel) screen
- Shorter screen: 16:9 against 18:9 on the dumpling
- No earphone/headphone jack, though they provide an adapter in the box)
- Weird placement of the power-key/fingerprint scanner, precisely in the center on the right-hand side of the device
- Sub-par performance of mic on phone calls, leaving the person on other side complaining about my voice
- Unintuitive form-factor and design meaning that the phone is not only heavy but also does not fit well in hands
- No face-unlock like they do have in OnePlus phones
- No notification LED on the front as it's now on the back in the form of the super-cool Razer Chroma logo
- Smaller/laggy camera coupled with a stock camera app with lesser features
- Weaker ROM development community
- No dual-SIM support, not that I ever use two SIM cards in my phones
- No sound slider, which I think you only find in OnePlus devices

## Early conclusion

It's quite obvious that the list of drawbacks is larger than the list of benefits. Does that make it a downgrade?

I love the phone specifically for a few things which are:

- Its resemblance to my ancient [Windows Mobile Pocket PCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_PC) back from the early 2000s
- Extra loud 'real' front-facing dual stereo speakers
- Razer Chroma logo
- The personality, rareness and overall feel of the phone

However, there are a few things I wish were different:

- An AMOLED screen, even a 1080p panel would've worked
- The power button could've been placed a little higher than where it is to make it a little easier to access it while holding the phone in human hands, the way humans do
- A lower color temperature or at least a way to change it according to my preference as the high temperature could later be achieved using software or even by wearing a pair of blue-blocking glasses!

## Final conclusion

No matter what others might say, I like my Razer Phone 2. :)

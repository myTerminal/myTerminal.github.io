## Transcript

The G-Shock GW-M500F is identical to the GW-500A I talked about in the last video, with quite a few differences that are easy to miss unless you look closely. To start with, these say multi-band 6 instead of WaveCeptor, which is the term Casio used for the technology in their watches. I think they upgraded from multiband 5 to multiband 6 in these. These are known to have improved solar charging, expanded world time zones, and different indicators on the dial, and this left one this time counting seconds instead of minutes of the hour, just like we saw in the GW-6900.  These are relatively smaller changes that may or may not matter to you, but we still haven’t talked about the biggest change yet. If you noticed, the time memo feature is gone, and it has been replaced with the standard countdown timer that was missing from the former. So now pressing this button displays the time for a chosen world city, while nothing happens if you keep it pressed.

I also have this other GW-M500F with a different color theme, which looks great, actually, and this GW-M500BA with apparently slightly different material on the bezel with some black ion coating if I’m not mistaken. I prefer the look of the left one as it is more stealthy, and the colors aren’t that loud and all over the place, except for the green hue on the screen.

So these are a slight upgrade over those we saw in the last video unless you really need to be able to record time memos.

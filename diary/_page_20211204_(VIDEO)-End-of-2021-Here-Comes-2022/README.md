## Last Year

So the last year was fun, we learned so much together, well I don't know about you, but at least I did, from the comments.

We talked a lot about Linux and my journey with the ThinkPad X1 Extreme. Out of the many things I learned while making these videos, and especially from the comments, I could configure my ThinkPad thrice, each time with an operating system totally different from the other.

## Next Year

For the next year, I plan to bring in some fresh content, and along with Linux and Emacs, we may be seeing several videos on some on my open-source projects, a brand new series on computer programming, if everything goes as planned, a few videos about cars, and then who knows what!

## Outro

So that's it for now, and I hope to see you in one of the future videos. Till then, keep learning and keep sharing!

## Transcript

I like the GW-M850. It’s partly because of this neat design aesthetic, the display appearing like a gauge cluster of an automobile, and then there are a couple of unique things that make it one of the only two G-Shocks with those features.

I’m not a fan of this dual tone on the bezel, and I’d rather have it all in one color, but when you look closer, everything on the dial makes it different than anything I’ve seen.

Apart from the world time, 5 alarms, stopwatch, and timer, the additional thing this watch features is the Rally mode, where you can measure your times on this first screen and then review your records on the other. Of course, these two modes will be a lot to cover in this video, but look at the attention to detail for how every time you change the mode, you see the text appear in an animated way from right to left. I’ve never seen that before! It even flashes the screen at certain events in this mode.

Apart from this, it has all the other goodies like solar charging, multi-band radio reception, auto-EL backlight, etc. I’m not sure I’ll ever use the Rally mode, but being a car enthusiast and a Rally fan, I’ll add it to my collection.

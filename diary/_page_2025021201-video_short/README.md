## Transcript

The ThinkPad X61s only keeps getting better. Many of us (including myself) cannot seem to ignore how dim the screen can be at times. But then I recently realized that these do get brighter after running for a while. It turns out these aging CCFL screens need time to warm up to be sufficiently bright. Look how it appears next to an X230. Of course, there would be differences in viewing angles, for which the X230 has a way better screen anyway, but I wonâ€™t complain about that on my X61s ever again.

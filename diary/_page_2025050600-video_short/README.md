## Transcript

So the G-9300 we saw in the last video arrived in almost perfect condition, with original tag, in the tin can, inside the box.

On the other hand, this GW-9300 (which is a Japanese variant) was pretty beaten up with dents and nicks all over the shell, straps, and even the main body. There are also minor scratches on the crystal, which I wish weren’t the case, but what can you say about a watch that came from another continent?

So, from a comparison perspective, this thing adds much more than just the multi-band radio reception.

The straps are Carbon-fiber reinforced, so the text here says Carbon Fiber instead of Tough Solar. We also get a carbon-fiber keeper instead of the metal one on the international version. The straps may be softer, either due to the difference in material, age, or maybe it’s just me. The module is also different, most likely for the atomic time-sync capability. The texture on the bottom protection layer on the international version is a slight matte, but on the Japanese version, it’s pretty smooth, which may also be due to aging and wearing off due to years of skin contact.

The screen here is a little low-contrast as compared to the international version, but the brighter EL just sells this one away, and it’s also more green than it is blue, just like the Japanese variants of other Casio watches. Now it was all a matter of deciding which one to keep and which one to let go.

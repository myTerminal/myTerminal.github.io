## Transcript

Most MTG models are pretty expensive, and I find it hard to justify the high price, especially since several regular G-Shock models offer quite a lot of it at an affordable price.

MRGs are an entirely different story. I haven’t been able to appreciate the modern MRG’s and the older or vintage ones do not look like value for money, especially with the screw back, which is something I’m very scared of.

I’m not able to justify all that extra money if regular G-Shocks and the Master of G Collection seem to provide me more than what I would ever need from a watch.

If I live long enough to change my mind, I may eventually get into one of these, but for now, I’m grateful to be able to say that I’m more than covered.

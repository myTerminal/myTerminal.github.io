## Transcript

I picked up this GA-150 for this stealthy color theme and contrasting hands. My experience when I received it was way different than what I anticipated. This watch may look small in pictures, but it is huge, and even the fit on my slender wrists isn’t the most comfortable. I’d say it’s even worse than that on the GW-6900, and it’s hard to believe that the GD-350 fits on my wrists better than the GA-150. Fit and comfort aren’t my only gripes with this watch, though. This strap is so wide that it rubs the buckle every time you move it in or out. Don’t even mention the backlight, as at least the one on the AWG-M100A illuminates the analog dial.

It has quite a few things in common with the GA-110 we saw recently, for example, how the beep isn’t used while you move between modes, making it a muted watch, and this speed dial for stopwatch mode.

Everything isn't bad, as there are several welcoming design choices like this hidden bar that is curved along the inside of the dial, and is used to show some metrics in certain modes, and also for animation while switching modes. The buttons are softer than we’re used to, and the entire package is pretty lightweight.

I have another one here with me with an interesting color way where the resin feels metallic until you touch it.

At the end of the day, trying this older watch helped me better appreciate the 2100 series, and also helped me answer my question on why they are so sought after even years after their initial launch.

## Transcript

This GMA-S110 is my first G-Shock from the Baby-G series. I find it not much smaller than a regular G-Shock, though, as a matter of fact, a little bulkier than the CasiOak.

The buttons are a little harder to press, and they do not make any sound, so the watch is effectively mute by default. I haven’t been able to find a way to change that. There’s the standard stopwatch, countdown timer with auto-repeat, world time, 5 alarms with hourly chimes, and yes, the auto-LED.

One of the only other things that makes this watch unique is this dedicated dial for the speed measurement in stopwatch mode. That is probably the reason the stopwatch has been kept in the first mode after the default timekeeping mode.

It lets you enter the distance before you start the stopwatch, and when you stop the counting, it displays the distance using this hand. I know calculating the distance using speed and time is pretty trivial, but this feature is something over my head.

So overall, this is a neat little watch with quite a lot of features, but unfortunately, it's not the kind I’d be able to appreciate, especially in this color.

## Transcript

I started my wristwatch exploration with digital watches with a battery, and then there were some with solar rechargeable batteries. But then the world of analog watches has so much more to learn from.

Almost all wristwatches powered by a battery use a quartz crystal to create vibrations that are used to show time, either on a digital display or through a set of rotating hands.

But then there are solar-powered watches that almost eliminate the need to replace batteries by using rechargeable batteries that are charged through most light sources, not only the sun.

Mechanical watches operate without external power, needing only to be wound by hand, and automatic watches automatically wind themselves with mere movements of the wrist. Some of these are a combination of both, providing self-winding and manual winding.

I also came across Kinetic movement, which is like a hybrid between automatic and quartz. These use a rotor (like automatic mechanical watches) to generate electricity as you move, which is then stored in a rechargeable battery or capacitor to power a quartz movement. There’s a lot of technology inside to enable the rotor to let it move at speeds which would otherwise wear it out, and it levitates mid-air to be able to do that.

But we need none of that these days, because we have the smart… well, never mind.

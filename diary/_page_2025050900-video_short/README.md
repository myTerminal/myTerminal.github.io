## Transcript

I’ve always wondered how the time on digital displays and those on the analog hands are always in sync. Well, that’s not always the case, as you can see on this GA-150, where the hands are out of sync with the actual time being shown on the screen.

Thankfully, that’s an easy fix. You only need to enter the H-set mode by keeping the lower right button pressed for five seconds, toggling between the sub-dial and main dial, and then making adjustments using these two buttons on the right. We need to get both hands to the 12 o'clock position. Once we’re almost done, we make a few minute adjustments, and we’re done.

On returning to the regular time-keeping mode, you can see that both the watches now show the same time on the analog hands, matching that with the digital time.

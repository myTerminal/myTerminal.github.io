## Transcript

Local commutes are one thing with my ThinkPads, but an international trip freaks me out! What would be my setup such that I do not carry a lot and still have myself covered for the entirety of the trip?

Some of my preferences are:

1. Something compact and light-weight
2. Something that can be charged with USB-C so that I could charge multiple devices with a lesser number of chargers
3. Something that has a longer battery runtime
4. Something that is an all-rounder ThinkPad

On my travels, I also prefer:

1. Something with a higher storage capacity so that I could access most if not all my data while I’m off-network
2. Something with better cooling for hotter parts of the world
3. Something rough and tough so that the airport security wouldn’t be able to do much damage trying to verify it is what it looks like
4. Something easily replaceable and for less money, in case things don’t go as planned

What do you consider for a travel notebook computer?

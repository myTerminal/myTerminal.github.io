In our last discussion, we delved into the initial set of questions crucial for understanding the requirements of your prospective computer purchase. Having navigated through that phase, the subsequent decision revolves around determining the type of computer that aligns with your needs.

## Desktop PCs: Powerhouse in a Corner

Desktop computers are great as stationary machines that you can dedicate to a corner of your house. At home, this is often your study table or desk. The good thing I find about these is that they do not have batteries that need to be charged, and I know several people who have not turned off their desktop computers for years. As a general rule, these could be much more powerful in terms of computing power, but we’ve seen that somewhat change over the last few years. If instead of buying a branded computer, you get one assembled, you could have exactly the machine you need with the best-suited configuration, and at a great price. Apart from being stuck to the table, the other problem these may pose is that they need a dedicated space, and for those of us who do not have it, we’d rather prefer portable computers.

## Laptop PCs: Portability Meets Performance

Laptop PCs, or notebooks as they’re also called, are the most obvious portable computers that have over the years come pretty much to the level of desktop computers in terms of power and speed. These come in various sizes and can be carried along, but have batteries that need to be charged and deteriorate over time. Most people prefer laptops for their flexibility, but some brands are more difficult to service than others, especially when compared to desktop computers.

There have been several sub-categories of laptop computers namely netbooks, ultrabooks, etc, and most of it depends on their portability, computing power, etc. There are also 2-in-1 laptops that come equipped with a touchscreen and can be turned into a tablet, often also coming with a digitizer for some creative work.

## Tablets and Diverse Form Factors

Tablets, with their diverse shapes and sizes, cater to a wide range of audiences. From casual gaming to multimedia enthusiasts and professionals engaged in note-taking and presentations, tablets offer versatility that aligns with specific user preferences. Needless to say, most models can be used for multiple entirely different uses.

## Beyond and Concluding Thoughts

While there may be other types worth exploring, the categories discussed thus far provide a solid starting point for most individuals embarking on their research. As it goes without saying, some of these would be “real” computers while others with relatively lightweight operating platforms.

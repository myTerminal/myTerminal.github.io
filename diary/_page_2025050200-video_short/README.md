## Transcript

So, previously I mentioned that I wanted to try a G-Shock from the Master of G collection, and I’m happy to introduce you to the Mudman G-9300. It’s much better than the Riseman and the Rangeman I was looking at from similar years, at least for me, being smaller, more comfortable, and definitely better looking, again, to me.

How can you talk about a Mudman and not talk about the harder buttons? I don’t care about them as they aren’t “that” had to press, at least as much as you’d think if you read about it all over the web. This thing is almost my best-looking watch, only next to the GD-350, which finally has some competition, and the Mudman now makes most other digital G-Shocks in my collection redundant.

Also, I have another Mudman with me, a GW-9300, the Japanese variant. It adds a lot of goodies, including multi-band radio reception, which I’ll cover in a dedicated video.

Overall, after trying the Mudman, it feels like this is the G-Shock I always wanted!

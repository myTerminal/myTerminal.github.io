## Introduction

So, how much are you willing to spend on your computer purchase? If you do know at this point, let’s look at a few factors that may help you decide. You do not want to spend less to buy something that doesn’t work for you, or otherwise overspend for things that you do not need.

## Long-term or Short-term?

Usually, things that are sold for less money aren’t of great quality to be able to last longer. If you’re looking for a computer that you do not need for a long time, you can save some money there.

However, if you’d like to have something that would keep running for a long time, it often comes as an additional price.

## Latest Technology is Expensive

If you’re someone who prefers to use the latest technology, then you will most likely have to pay more. This is because, computers and electronics lose their value as newer technology makes them look obsolete, which if you do not know, happens way quicker these years than it used to earlier. If you’d rather save some money, you might have to get into old technology that still satisfies your needs but isn’t as expensive today as it was a year ago.

## Selling Old Computers

One thing that I like to do before (or after) a purchase is to sell the stuff that I do not need. With the money that I get back, I can add it to the purchase to get something better or at least not pay for the entire purchase out of my pocket.

## Form-factors, Genres and Brands

Certain kinds of computers of more expensive than others, and the price also varies across brands, lineups within brands, etc. which we’ll talk about in the next video.

## Transcript

The Casio LA20WH is a cute little watch that comes in a lot of colors that would attract a wide range of audiences with smaller or rather tiny wrists. It is well-made, is water resistant, and provides a little more than just time-keeping, which includes a basic stopwatch, alarm, hourly chimes, and even a backlight. It is also pretty affordable, with everything that I just talked about, and even the battery on this thing could last up to 5 years.

This particular example has seen some use; it is seen by how the straps have started to change color. I wish I could have reviewed it before the discoloration, but that gives me a reason to steer away from lighter color straps in the future, or maybe with how careful I am with my watches, this would never be the case with them.

## Transcript

One of the things I love to do is cleaning, well, at least my nerd toys. This G-Shock GW-6900 is spotless, as this is how I keep it, but this one isn’t. It has dirt and filth, and some marks that appear like wear-offs. So let’s try cleaning it up and try to bring it as close as possible to the other one.

We’ll use some diluted dish soap and a toothbrush with the softest bristles so that we do not scratch the watch. All that you have to do is spray and scrub, less on the areas where it is relatively clean and more where you need more cleaning.

Once we’re done, we have a quick rinse with water and wipe with a microfiber towel. So this is how it turned out. I’m kidding! This is the clean one, and this is the one that we just cleaned. You can’t tell the difference, can you? So that was all, and this old watch is almost as good as new!

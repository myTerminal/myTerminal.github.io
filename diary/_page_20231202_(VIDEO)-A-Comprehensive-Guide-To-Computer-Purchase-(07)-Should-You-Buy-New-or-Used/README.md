## Introduction

Would you buy new or used? To me, the answer to this question takes the purchase in entirely different directions in terms of prices, relevance, warranty, and more.

## Why Buy New?

Buying new has clear advantages, some of them being:

1. You can potentially get access to hardware based on the latest technology.
2. The machine will most certainly supported by a complementary warranty.
3. Components that wear off with use, like the battery will be brand new.
4. The machine will have no signs of use whatsoever and you’ll get to feel the joy of unpacking your machine from the box.

## Why Buy Old?

Buying old, which is my favorite, has its own set of advantages:

1. It can save you a lot of money.
2. If you still spend as much as you would have while buying new, you could get something far better for the same price.
3. You don't have to lose money on the depreciation as new machines do and probably sell it for around the same price as you purchased it for.
4. You can split your purchase into multiple computers to create a fleet of complementing machines, each for a different use, for example, heavy work, travel, etc.

## Coming Up…

As either of the two has so many differences in the way you’d approach a purchase, we’ll look at each of them a little closer in the upcoming videos.

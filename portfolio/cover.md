## Summary

I like to work with software, computers, gadgets, cars, and almost every other mechanical thing that can be tinkered with. Apart from re-arranging lines of computer code, I also like to plan and visualize, delete data and check items off a list.

## Career

I'm a passionate, self-motivated software engineer with twelve years of professional experience and over seventeen years of overall experience working with computer software. My strong attention to detail also applies to the software solutions I generate.

I started my professional career back in 2009 with Microsoft technologies like .NET, WPF, and Silverlight. Not too far into my career, I ended up getting dragged to the front-end and that gave me an entirely new universe of things to explore. After spending a few years on front-end heavy full-stack roles, I started planning my way back to full-stack, but with so much going on in the front-end space, I still often have to keep shifting my focus.

## Work life

I write code at work and outside as well. My addiction to technology, curiosity to learn more, and passion for continuous improvement enables me to self-learn and solve problems at my organization including the ones that lie within and outside my team deliverables. I'm also known to be someone who is always ready to share exciting stuff within the team and beyond, and people call me technically inspiring.

It does not take long for me to turn myself from an introverted team-mate to a talkative extrovert especially if the ongoing conversation happens to fall within (or even passes through) one of my interest areas. I do find it hard to stop myself from boring my colleagues with technical details that I wasn't asked about in the first place.

## Computer Software

Working with computers is one of my strongest addictions and I consider it as something more than just a means to earn my living. I'm a regular contributor to open-source software and have a decent reputation in online software development communities.

Over the last decade, there's been a huge shift in the way I interact with computers. What used to be only around Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS has now been replaced entirely with Unix-like operating systems like Linux and Mac.

## Personality

I'm scientific, methodical, and a little over-organized. I like to keep everything around me in proper order and treat everything coming my way with respect and sincerity.

## Interests

Outside of computers, I like to tinker with (and maintain) my gadgets, play role-playing and strategy video games when time permits. I also have an unusually strong passion for cars which forms an area of exploration that consumes much of my time. Though I prefer three pedals instead of two, it's hard for me to let go of even a slim chance to get behind the wheels of anything that rolls.

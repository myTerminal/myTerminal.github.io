## Summary

I like to work with software, computers, gadgets, cars, and almost every other mechanical thing that can be tinkered with. Apart from re-arranging lines of computer code, I also like to plan and visualize, delete data and check items off a list.

## Career

I'm a passionate computer & technology enthusiast with thirteen years of professional and over eighteen years of overall experience working with computer software. My strong attention to detail also applies to the software solutions I deliver.

Having started my professional career back in 2009 with Microsoft technologies like .NET, WPF, and Silverlight and then later having spent most later half on the front-end, I prefer not to limit myself to the language, frameworks, libraries, or platforms that I work with. Instead, I see them as tools to achieve results, which is mostly solving real-world problems using computer code.

## Work Life

My outlook towards technology, curiosity to learn more, and passion for continuous improvement enables me to self-learn and solve problems at my organization that includes not only the ones in my current assignment but also often those that lie outside my primary deliverables. I'm also known to be someone who is always willing to share exciting stuff within the team and beyond, which may be the reason people call me technically inspiring.

## Personal Life

Interacting with code happens at both work and off work. Working with computers is one of my primary interests and I consider it as something more than just a means to earn my living. Outside of work, I'm a regular contributor to open-source software and have a decent reputation in online software development communities.

## Personality

I'm scientific, methodical, and a little overorganized. I like to keep everything around me in proper order and treat anything coming my way with respect and sincerity. For me, it is very important for me to believe in and be proud of what I do.

## Interests

Outside of computers, I like to tinker with my gadgets, improve my daily workflow, and play role-playing and strategy video games when time permits. I also have an unusually strong passion for cars and though I prefer three pedals instead of two, I still try to get behind the wheel of anything that rolls.

## Summary

I work with software, computers, gadgets, cars and almost every non-living thing that can be tinkered with. I also like to delete files, re-arrange lines of computer code and check items off a list.

## Career

I'm a passionate, self-motivated software engineer with almost eleven years of professional experience and almost sixteen years of overall programming experience. I have strong attention to detail in all my work, even my code: I like to keep it very organized.

I started my professional career back in 2009 with Microsoft technologies like .NET, WPF, and Silverlight to create desktop and web applications. Not foo far into my career, I ended up getting dragged to the front-end which gave it an entirely new direction but with so much going on and an infinite list of things to learn, it hardly lets me leave.

## Work life

I write code at work too. My addiction to technology, curiosity to learn more and passion for continuous-improvement enables me to self-learn and help people around me for problems lying within and outside the regular project work. I'm also known as someone always ready to share exciting stuff within the team and beyond, and is motivating and technically inspirational.

I do often end up boring my colleagues with technical details and quickly transform myself from an introvert team-mate to a talkative guy as soon as the conversation passes through one of my interests.

## Computer Software

Working with computers is one of my strongest addictions and I consider it as something more than just a means to earn my living. I'm a regular contributor to open-source software and have a decent reputation on programming puzzle websites.

Over the last decade, there's been a huge shift in my interaction with computers. It used to be all only around Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS but has been mostly Unix-like operating systems like Linux and Mac for quite a while now.

## Personality

I'm methodical, organized and technically inspirational. I find myself over-organized. I like to keep everything around me in proper order and treat everything coming my way with respect and sincerity.

## Interests

Outside of computers I appreciate soft trance and relaxing down-tempo music, like to tinker with (and maintain) my gadgets, and play role-playing video games when time permits. I also have an unusually strong passion for cars which forms a topic that I waste a lot of time learning and talking about, leave alone driving all possible cars that I can.

Most of my work resides on GitHub as:

* [GitHub/myTerminal](https://github.com/myTerminal) consisting of my personal open-source projects that range from
    * Front-end libraries
    * Node.js libraries and apps
    * Small web-apps
    * Emacs starter-kits, extensions and color themes
    * Useful Bash scripts
    * Google Chrome extensions
    * Project templates and boilerplate code
    * Documentation projects, lists and training-material
    * Docker images
    * ... more
* [GitHub/team-fluxion](https://github.com/team-fluxion) consisting a few open-source projects that I'm a contributor of, at my childhood organization
* [GitLab/myTerminal](https://gitlab.com/myTerminal) in form of over a hundred private projects that are well, private

Most of my libraries and extensions listed above are also hosted on their respective package-managers:

* Tens of NPM and Bower libraries hosted on [my NPM profile](https://www.npmjs.com/~myterminal)
* A decent number of opinionately useless Emacs extensions hosted on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/?q=myterminal), [MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/#/?q=myterminal), [Marmalade](https://marmalade-repo.org/profile/myTerminal), etc.

Finally, I've also contributed to the community in other ways with:

* My answers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1749585/myterminal) (and other StackExchange communities)
* Videos on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPRuuspWO9v2BEbgyL0wsg)
* Posts on [my Dev.to profile](https://dev.to/myterminal) with over 1.2k+ followers

And there may be more that I don't realize.

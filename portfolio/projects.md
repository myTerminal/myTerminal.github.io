Most of my work is available on the web:

* [GitHub/myTerminal](https://github.com/myTerminal) consisting of my open-source projects that include Front-end libraries, Node.js libraries and apps, Lisp applications, Rust crates, Bash scripts, Google Chrome extensions, Emacs projects (starter kits, extensions, and color themes), project templates and boilerplate code, documentation projects, lists, and training material, and more
* [GitHub/team-fluxion](https://github.com/team-fluxion) where I'm also a contributor to a few open-source software projects
* [GitLab/myTerminal](https://gitlab.com/myTerminal) in the form of over a hundred private software projects

Most of my libraries and extensions listed above are also hosted on their respective package managers:

* Tens of NPM and Bower libraries hosted on [my NPM profile](https://www.npmjs.com/~myterminal)
* Rust crates hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io)
* A decent number of opinionately useless Emacs extensions hosted on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/?q=myterminal), [MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/#/?q=myterminal), [Marmalade](https://marmalade-repo.org/profile/myTerminal), etc.

Finally, I've also contributed to the community in other ways:

* Answers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1749585/myterminal) (and other StackExchange communities)
* Posts on [my Dev.to profile](https://dev.to/myterminal) with over 1.3k+ followers
* Videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/myTerminal) and [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@myTerminal:1)
* Books on [Gumroad](https://myterminal.gumroad.com), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/books), and otherwise.
